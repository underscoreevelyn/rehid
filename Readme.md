# Rehid

This is a modification of [rehid](https://github.com/hax0kartik/rehid), a 3ds button remapper, to add basic turbo support. It's incredibly janky and inconsistent, and I wouldn't taint your console with my code, but it *technically* works so feel free to build and try it out. 

Turbo is applied globally when a specific button combination is pressed. Add a "turbocombo" entry to your json configuration to enable it.
